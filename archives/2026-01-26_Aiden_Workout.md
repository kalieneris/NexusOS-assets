## Trainer Directives
THE VERTICAL ASCENT.

We’re fixing the pull-up bottleneck today. Use the 'Shorten the Leash' method with your Black/Green band for a spot.

Focus on the stretch at the bottom. Keep your shoulders engaged—don't just hang like a ragdoll.

## Trainer Closing Notes
1. Pull-Ups: Did the band give you enough help to hit 8-10 clean reps?
2. Pushups: Did you hit failure before the 12-rep mark?
3. Protein: Did you clear that 150g target?

## Athlete Feedback
Added WGS to third set of sun salutations.
Scapular pull ups with chair assist.
Pull ups with chair assist.
Push ups 3 count down, explode up in 1.

Used more chair assist as I went on with pull ups to keep good form while still playing my muscles as far as they'd go.
