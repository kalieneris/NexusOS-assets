## Trainer Directives
THE RETURN.

We are back on the grid. We take the baseline established in Session 5 and apply Progressive Overload.

1. Pull-Ups: Use the Chair Assist. Focus strictly on the 3-second negative.
2. Pushups: You mastered the rep; now master the tension. Add a 1-second PAUSE at the bottom of every rep.

## Trainer Closing Notes
1. Pull-Ups: Did the Chair Assist allow you to feel the lats stretch?
2. Pause Pushups: Did the pause force you to drop reps, or did you hold 12?
3. Protein: 150g. Back on the wagon.

## Athlete Feedback
Used neutral grip for scapulars
I don't understand how people do this for fun. This is torture.

Yes on the chair assist. Jumped up to chin over bar and then slowly let myself down. Definitely felt it in the lats.
Dropped reps on pushups.
Aye aye on the protein.
