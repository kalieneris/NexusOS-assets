## Trainer Directives
THE FRICTIONLESS POSTERIOR.

Optimized for workflow. We clear the heavy 68lb Barbell work first (Block A), then break it down ONCE for the Dumbbell work (Block B).

Focus: 1-second squeeze on Hip Thrusts. Depth on Lunges.

## Trainer Closing Notes
1. Hip Thrusts: Did the batched set allow you to keep the intensity high?
2. Reverse Lunges: How was the grip/balance on the second block?
3. Protein: 150g. Status?

## Athlete Feedback
Accidentally did side planks for the first set of plank.
Also accidentally did 68lbs for the first 2 sets of reverse lunges. No wonder they were so hard.
Holy shit that was exhausting!
That was a long one.
